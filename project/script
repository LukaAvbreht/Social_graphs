<director shot>
	When creating a movie, a director has the opportunity to shape every frame, every dialog as he/she likes, </cut> therefor giving an infinite number of possibilities when shooting a movie.

<looking for movie>
	often when we watch a new movie, we feel like "oh, i've seen this before" or "it was too predictable"
</looking for movie><10s>
But what makes a movie redundant ? What are the codes and lazy habits ? That's what we are trying to figure out ! <illustration of the group with names> <8s>

For our research, we are using the Kaggle's movie data set,
<blur> which is split in 7 files and include <show entries> several data points like titles, budgets and genres just to name a few.
<other image>
In addition to metadata, we are using movies' subtitles <blur + open subtitle logo> from OpenSubtitle to get a deeper understanding of each movie.
<word cloud example ?>For example, we will be looking for which words are the most used depending on a movie's genre and it's director.

<other photo> The whole data set we are using contains around 45000 movies. <transition> 
Metadata and subtitles combined account for more than 60 GB of data.

<other photo>But, because of performance and space issues, we decided to only work with a subset of data. We chose 5000 movies with the highest revenue that already came out.

So first, we are creating a network where every node is a director and they are linked together if they have employed the same actor.
<Simple representation of dirA - actA - dirB>
If we draw the graph for our 18.694 actors and 2050 directors <fusion effect>, we get this graph. 
<Display total graph with weights & degree distribution>

Because the first graph we tried to draw is too crowded, we decided to create the actor's graph as well. 
Two actors are linked together if they appeared on the same movie.
To avoid having too much nodes, we only selected actors with at least 500 connections.


But then, once we will have our results, what could we do with them ? Well we will try to predict the "most predictable" movie from the most popular genre. This includes casting the best actors and director.
