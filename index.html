                    <p>
                        When creating a movie, a director has the opportunity to shape every frame, every dialog as
                        he/she likes, therefor giving an infinite number of possibilities when shooting a movie.

                        However, often when we watch a new movie, we feel like "Oh, I have seen this before" or "It was
                        too predictable".

                        But what makes a movie redundant ? What are the codes and lazy habits ?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our goal is to provide an overview of directors and how they link to each. We will create a network of directors where two directors are linked if they have hired any of the same actors. We want to find out what kind of network this is, who the most central directors are and whether there are any communities within it. On top of this we will analyse the subtitles for every movie of these directors.</p>

                    <p>
                       The original Movies Dataset consists of 6 files:
                        <ul>
                            <li>movies_metadata.csv: The main Movies Metadata file. Contains information on 45,000 movies featured in the Full MovieLens dataset. Features include posters, backdrops, budget, revenue, release dates, languages, production countries and companies.
                            </li>
                            <li>keywords.csv: Contains the movie plot keywords for our MovieLens movies. Available in the form of a stringified JSON Object.</li>
                            <li>credits.csv: Consists of Cast and Crew Information for all our movies. Available in the form of a stringified JSON Object.</li>
                            <li>links.csv: The file that contains the TMDB and IMDB IDs of all the movies featured in the Full MovieLens dataset.</li>
                            <li>links_small.csv: Contains the TMDB and IMDB IDs of a small subset of 9,000 movies of the Full Dataset.</li>
                            <li>ratings_small.csv: The subset of 100,000 ratings from 700 users on 9,000 movies.</li>
                        </ul>
The original dataset contains over 45.000 movies and we decided that this was an unnecessary amount of data for our purposes. We chose to work on a subset of the data to make it easier to work with. We wanted to make sure we included every "known" director so to speak. We did not care if we lost information about directors that for example have only created one movie or a few movies which did not receive high publicity. We decided to filter the directors based on how many votes or ratings they had gotten. The vote number for each movie is in the dataset, so it was a straightforward procedure to get the total vote count for each director. We decided to set the limit at 500 votes, i.e. only include directors that have received a total of over 500 votes. We chose 500 partly because that is a "significant" amount and because that would get our data size down to a more suitible size.

Filtering the original data gave us a dataset of 10.605 movies and 1.273 directors. With this we created the network of directors which consists of 1.273 nodes and 217.725 edges.

                        In this part we will analyse the network of directors. The nodes of the network are directors
                        and two directors are connected if they have ever hired the same actor. The network consists of
                        1273 nodes and 217,725 edges. We will analyse the structure of the network and the centrality of
                        nodes. Then we will analyse the communities of the network.

                            and a few nodes with a very high degree. When plotting the degree distribution of a network
                            that follows the power law with loglog axes it should resemble a straigh line (or close to
                            that).</p>

                        <p>In a nework with a power-law degree distribution the friendship paradox is true. The paradox
                            states that almost everyone has fewer friends than their friends have on average. Meaning
                            that the degree of most nodes is lower that the average degree of its neighbours. Even
                            though we found that our network does not really have a power-law degree distribution the
                            friendship paradox is still true for most nodes, so the network does still some property of

                        <p>Does the small world propery hold in our network? The small-world property states that the
                            distance between two nodes is very small compared to the size of the network. The
                            mathematical formula that states whether a netork has the small-world property is printed
                            below (ch. 3 in Network Science book).</p>

                            distribution either. However the friendship paradox is true for 92.4% percente of the nodes
                            and it does have the small world property. To sum up it does resemble a real-life network
                            more than a random network.</p>

                    Their vote count is high compared to the rest of the network, but their rating is not that high.
                    This shows that directors who are central in the network do not necessary have a high rating.
                    However their vote count is also an indicator of popularity or at least of how famous they are, and
                    this is quite high for all of them. The fact that they all have a high number of movies is not
                    surprising as this will of course give them a higher probality of being connected with other
                    directors. Their genres are all very popular genres which also increases the likelihood that they
                    share actors with other directors.

                    <p style="margin-top: 30px">The modularity is 0,228. The modularity is above 0 which means that
                        there are more edges within the communities than there are across communities. However the
                        modularity is not that high which means that the community are not that well defined.</p>

                    <p>The plot above illustrates the communities using different colours for each community. We see
                        that the network is split into three bigger parts and two smaller parts at the right and one
                        small community inside another one</p>
                    <h3>Analysis of communities</h3>
                    <p>We will look at three different attributes: language, genre, active period and rating, to see if
                        anything can be said about the communities regarding these. We want to find out if the
                        communities can be distinguished using any of these attributes.</p>

                    <h3>Languages</h3>
                    <p> We have seperated the directors into groups of languages based on the language of their
                        movies.</p>

                                of the community that direct movies of that specific language. Community 3 and 5 seem to
                                be based on language. Community 3 mostly has mostly directors of french movies and some
                                italian movies, community 5 mostly directors of japanese and cantonese movies. The other
                                communities have mostly directors of english movies however community 2 does have a
                                higher percentage of movies of many of the smaller languages than the other
                                communities. </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Genres</h3>
                    <p>We have created one group for each genre and added directors to the groups that they have worked
                        whithin. One director might have worked in more than one genre.</p>
                    <div class="indented" style="display: flex; align-items: center; flex-direction: row">
                        <img style="display: flex; flex:5;" src="images/confusion_matrix_genres.png"

                                of the community that have directed movies in that specific genre. As mentioned above,
                                each directed might have worked in multiple genres therefor the percentages for one
                                community do not add up to 100%. </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>We observe that all communities are a mix of multiple genres which makes sense since we know that
                        directors and actors do not restrict themselves to a single genre. There are some genres that
                        are quite common among all communities such as drama, comedy, romance, thriller and action.
                        These are all genres that are somewhat general and a lot of movies will have these genres listed
                        as their genre along with other more significant genres. There are however some differences
                        between the communities that might be of significans. Communty 4 has directors working in
                        multiple genres that are not as common in the other communities such as music, history, mystery,
                        western and war. Community 5 has a high percentage of directors working in the genres foreign,
                        fantasy and science fiction. Community 1 has a high percentage of directors working in the
                        genres thrillers, mystery, horror and science fiction.</p>

                    <h3>Active Period</h3>
                    <p> We have created one group for each decade and add directors to the group if they were active in
                        that decade. We define the active period of a director as the time from the release of the first
                        movie to the release of the last movie.</p>
                    <div class="indented" style="display: flex; align-items: center; flex-direction: row">
                        <img style="display: flex; flex:5;" src="images/confusion_matrix_period.png"

                        <div style="display: flex; flex: 3; padding-left: 20px">
                            <p style="display: flex;"> The figure shows a heatmap where each cell is the percentage of
                                the community that were active in that decade. A director can be active over a period of
                                more than 10 years and hence can be in multiple groups. Therefor the percentages of each
                                community do not add up to 100%. We observe that community 4 consists mainly of older
                                movies. It makes sense that the directors of older movies are grouped together as not
                                many of the same actors are acting in older as well as newer movies. We can also spot
                                that directors of movies released after year 2000 are in community 0 and 2, while
                                directors of movies from 1980-2000 are more dominant in community 1. Community 3 and 5
                                are not as concentrated on a specific period but are spread out from 1970 until
                                2020. </p>

                    <h3>Rating</h3>
                    <p>We have divided the ratings into 5 groups of equal size: low, medium-low, medium, medium-high and
                        high. The directors are then added to the group for which their agerage rating falls within.</p>

                                correlation between rating and communities. Community 0 and 1 have a larger part of low
                                rating directors while community 2, 3 and 5 have a larger part of high rating directors.
                                Community 4 has the largest part around the medium rating. However there is not a huge
                                difference in the numbers. </p>

                    <h3>Conclusion about communities</h3>
                    <p>So what can we say about the communities? First of all, the modularity is not significantly high,
                        so the communities are not that solid. We examined different groupings of the directors to see
                        if there is a correlation with the found communities. We tried grouping the directors by
                        language, by genre, by active period and by rating. We discovered the following about the
                        communities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Community 0 consists almost solely of directors of english movies. Regarding active period
                            it consists mostly of directors active in the recent decades.
                        </li>
                        <li>Community 1 also consist mainly of directors of english movies. It has a high percentage of
                            directors working in drama, thrillers and action. Over half of the community has been rated
                            below medium and most directors were active in the years 1980-2010.
                        </li>
                        <li>Community 2 has a higher number of percentage of directors working in many of the smaller
                            languages than the other communities. It consists mainly of directors active after 1990.
                            Almost haf of the community has been rated above average.
                        </li>
                        <li>Community 3 consists mainly of directors of french and italian movies. Most of the directors
                            in that community are working with commedy and drama. The directors have been active in the
                            last 50 or so years. Over half of the community has been rated above average.
                        </li>
                        <li>Community 4 is characteries as being the community of directors of older movies. Most
                            directors were active in the years 1940-1990. The genres are also a bit different than of
                            the other communities. These directors were working more in the genres music, history,
                            mystery, western and war which are genres that were more popular a few decades ago than they
                            are today.
                        </li>
                        <li>Community 5 consists mainly of directors of japanese and cantonese movies. These directors
                            are directing foreign, fantasy and science fiction movies and a more than a third of the
                            community has received a high rating.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The analysis showed that some of the communities seem to be defined by attributes such as
                        language (3 and 5) and active period (4) while the others are more mixed and it's harder to
                        distinguish what makes the community.
                    </p>
                    <b>So in what communities are our most central directors?</b>
                    <p> Our guess would be in the mixed communities 0, 1 or 2. These are afterall also the largest
                        communities and they seem to hold the more mainstreem directors.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Steven Spielberg: 2</li>
                        <li>Woody Allen: 1</li>
                        <li>Ridley Scott: 2</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The most central nodes are indeed in communies 1 and 2.</p>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        The network we created consisted of movie directors which are connected if they have hired the
                        same actors. The structure of the network resembles that of a social network and the small world
                        property holds. The top three directors regarding centrality are all famous directors which have
                        directed a lot of movies and mostly work in the more popular genres.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We found 6 communities within the network and analysed these to find out what made these
                        communities. We found out that some of the communities seemed to be based on language and the
                        active periods of the directors while some were more a general mix.

                    <p>
                        While working with our wordclouds, we found quickly which genres where linked together and by
                        which environment. In appears that some genres are clustered together most of the time because
                        of a serie of movie or some sort of synergy.

When looking deeper into it, it appears that because a lot of japanese movies got famous worldwide, they got translated in english, which got them in our dataset.

                                    Furthermore, japanese characters in movies are known for calling each others out during battle, which could explain why we have a lot of hero's names in our wordcloud.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        In addition, we found an unusual word here for subtitles, "Torrente". At first we thought that it could be because of some subtitles where the word would be written to notify a specific download link for pirates or others. In this case, "Torrente" would appear in every wordcloud, so we dug deeper. In the end, it seems like there are multiple movies about a cop in spain.

                        In this section, we will take a closer look at what the text from movie subtitles can tell us
                        about the movies and their authors, the directors!

                    <p>Using LabMT wordlist downloaded from the article <a
                            href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026752">Temporal

                        The file represents a set of 10,222 words, their average happiness evaluations according to
                        users on Mechanical Turk and some other information that we are not using in this project.</p>
                    <p>
                        We started by loading subtitles of our movies and making a token list out of them, removed
                        stopword and calculated the sentiment value of each subtitle file and called this value the
                        sentiment of the movie. In the figure, we can see the distribution of sentiment.

                        Movie sentiments seem to be distributed normally. The numerical values for this data set are as
                        follow:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The average sentiment of movies is: 4.8984</li>
                        <li>The standard deviation of movies is: 0.2850</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Movies, in general, seem to be quite happy texts. If we compare these values to the values
                        we found when analyzing political tweets of us politicians in assignment two of this subject,
                        the average sentiment when removing the tweets with the sentiment value of 0 was around 4.3,
                        which is still 0.5 lower than this data set. For more information on tweet analysis
                        checkout our <a href="02_Assignment/assignment2.ipynb">assignment 2 notebook</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can also notice that the standard deviation of movie sentiment is much lower than the tweet
                        one.
                        One of the possible reasons is probably due to the length of the movies being bigger.
                    </p>

            </div>
            <div class="row">

                    <h5 class="card-title">Positive and negative movies</h5>
                    <p>
                        We then decided to take a look at the movies that stand out from the crowd. We selected the
                        movies that were more than two standard deviations away from the mean.
                        We called the movies with small values negative or sad movies and the movies with high sentiment
                        values positive or happy movies.
                    </p>
                    <p>With these restrictions we got </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>277 sad movies</li>
                        <li>37 happy movies</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For both movie t sets, we computed their tf-ids and created the word cloud that will hopefully
                        give us more inside to the words used in each of the extremes. The word clouds can be seen in
                        the figures below:</p>

                        The word cloud is not as representative as we hoped.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, there were quite some words we expected in positive movies. For example, Christmas seems
                        to be present in happy movies a lot. We also noticed some Spanish words the clouds, for example,
                        chica that seems to be a popular word in positive movies. In our great surprise word, Bieber
                        seems to be the most represented word in positive movies set. Words like youtube and applejack
                        also surprised us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The negative movie word cloud surprised us more. This is mostly due to us only having sentiment
                        scores for the English language. This analysis could be improved by adding sentiment values for
                        other languages. Anyway, words like chffffff seem to have no real meaning. There were also a lot
                        of words that seem like stopword from other languages. There were also quite a few words that
                        seem were to be expected in the sad movie set, for example screeching, danger, justice, army and
                        so on.
                    </p>

                </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Sentiment of directors</h5>
                    <p>
                        We then grouped the movies of each director. We were again interested in the distribution of
                        sentiment of each director. The results can be seen in the figure below:
                    </p>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>There is no surprise that the sentiment is again distributed normally. The numerical values are
                        as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The average sentiment of directors work is: 4.9084</li>
                        <li>The standard deviation of directors work is: 0.1878</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Again the sentiment of the director's work is even higher than the tweeter one. It is also higher
                        than the average movie sentiment. </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Positive and negative Directors</h5>
                    <p>
                        We again selected happy/positive and sad/negative directors using the same criteria as with
                        movies to get two sets of directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>The sizes of the sets are as follows: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>43 sad directors</li>
                        <li>19 happy directors</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For reasons stated before we are not surprised that there are quite a few non-English speaking
                        directors in the negative set since most of their work is not in English.</p>

                    <p>We again generated word clouds for each director group and got the following word clouds</p>

                        The results of positive and negative director work surprised us a lot. Words like Pikachu, Pika,
                        Anakin, and words like that surprised us a lot. The Positive word cloud was even weirder. There
                        where almost only names in it and maybe some words that we could make sense of, for example,
                        pajamas
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We focused on three directors that were in the most central nodes in most of the centrality
                        measures. We did in the network analysis part of this project for the following three Directors:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ridley Scott</li>
                        <li>Woody Allen</li>
                        <li>Steven Spielberg</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We first took a look at their sentiment in comparison to other directors. This can be seen very
                        well in figure bellow
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-wrap center">

                    </div>
                    <p>It comes as no surprise that out of these three, Woody Allen has the highest sentiment since he
                        is known more for his work in romantic and drama genres of movies. Both Ridley Scott know for
                        Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator ... and Steven Spielberg is known for Jaws, Jurassic Park,
                        Schindler's list ... are more of directors that normally produce a bit darker movies, and
                        therefore have a lower average sentiment. </p>

                    <p>We also generated the word clouds comparing and representing their work.</p>

                    <p> In Ridley Scott word clouds there are quite a few names from greek mythology, such as Maximus,
                        Hermes, and Ramses which comes as no surprise. There are also words like rover and starling that
                        point to more fantasy/space movies. </p>

                    <p>Woody Allen uses words like actresses, sexy and novel a lot which also comes as no surprise since
                        his style is more romantic and easy-going. </p>

                    <p>Steven Spielberg uses words like the grail, nicht, and ark in his work, which tells us something
                        about his more adventure colored movies. As with the other two directors, a lot of words in
                        clouds are the character names, especially if there are more movies with the same
                        characters.</p>
                    <p>Just by analyzing word clouds of different directors, we can tell something about their style.
                        Both Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg make more action and sci-fi movies when Allen produces
                        mostly drama movies.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Language diversity for directors</h5>
                    <p>
                        We also analyzed the language diversity used by directors.
                    </p>

                    <p>What even is language diversity.</p>
                    <p>We call language diversity the measure of how many different words are used in directors'
                        vocabulary compared to their vocabulary size.</p>

                    <p>We can see the language diversity distribution of director's work in figure bellow</p>

                    <div class="image-wrap center">
                        <img style="margin-bottom: 30px" src="images/fig11_director_lang_diversity.png"
                             alt="director_sentiment"
                             class="rounded img-fluid image image-2">
                        <div class="text">
                            <span class="position"> Distribution of language diversity of directors </span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        As expected the distribution of language diversity seems to be normal. Again the numerical
                        values are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Average language diversity of directors work is: 0.2229</li>
                        <li>Standard language diversity of directors work is: 0.0770</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        It seems like this measure alone doesn't tell us much about directors. We see that popular
                        directors
                        are the ones that have really low diversity value, but that is mainly due to them having made a
                        lot
                        of movies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lets again take a look at the central director's ant their diversity. These measures are the
                        best
                        represented in the figure below.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We suspect that the reason for their low diversity is mostly due to them having made a lot of
                        movies, and therefore even if they are having really big vocabulary still doesn't outweigh the
                        combined length of their work
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        directors' work. We did that by selecting the 75 most used words in their work by counting it
                        and sorting it. We then plotted the results in the next figures.

                    <p>We can see that the frequencies look quite similar for all directors. This is probably due to the
                        common words used in everyday English that outweigh the ones that may represent each individual
                        director..</p>

                        We were also interested in how movies changed over time. To get an inside in this kind of
                        information we used lexical dispersity visualization. This is done marking each occurrence of a
                        word in text by a small line and then plotting the graph. With this, we get an inside on how
                        texts change over time.

                    <p>
                        For this need, we ordered all of our movie data by their release date, and then join them all
                        together. We tried generating the plots for quite some words, some of them are representative
                        and some of them just seem to be too common to tell us anything about the change in the language
                        used.

                        rough placement of Indiana Jones movies that was brought to life by Steven Spielberg
                        and George Lucas and played by Harrison Ford. We also plotted some other words that
                        are specific to famous movies, for example, Potter, Bond, Batman, Jedi...

                        We also tried doing the same for the directors with the highest centrality. We again
                        selected their work and picked out some words that seem to be interesting for each
                        of the selected directors, and some universal ones.
