					<p>
						When creating a movie, a director has the opportunity to shape every frame, every dialog as he/she likes, therefor giving an infinite number of possibilities when shooting a movie.
                        
                        However, often when we watch a new movie, we feel like "Oh, I have seen this before" or "It was too predictable".

                        But what makes a movie redundant ? What are the codes and lazy habits ?

                        <p>A scale-free network is a network whose degree distribution follows a power law. (ch. 4 in networks book). The power law states that there are a lot of nodes with a very small degree and a few nodes with a very high degree. When plotting the degree distribution of a network that follows the power law with loglog axes it should resemble a straigh line (or close to that).</p>

                        <p>In a nework with a power-law degree distribution the friendship paradox is true. The paradox states that almost everyone has fewer friends than their friends have on average. Meaning that the degree of most nodes is lower that the average degree of its neighbours. Even though we found that our network does not really have a power-law degree distribution the friendship paradox is still true for most nodes, so the network does still some property of a real-life network.</p>

                        <p>Does the small world propery hold in our network? The small-world property states that the distance between two nodes is very small compared to the size of the network. The mathematical formula that states whether a netork has the small-world property is printed below (ch. 3 in Network Science book).</p>

                        <h3>Conclusion regarding degree distribution</h3>
                        <p>The network does not resemble a random network but it does not have a clear power-law degree distribution either. However the friendship paradox is true for 92.4% percente of the nodes and it does have the small world property. To sum up it does resemble a real-life network more than a random network.</p>

                    Their vote count is high compared to the rest of the network, but their rating is not that high. This shows that directors who are central in the network do not necessary have a high rating. However their vote count is also an indicator of popularity or at least of how famous they are, and this is quite high for all of them. The fact that they all have a high number of movies is not surprising as this will of course give them a higher probality of being connected with other directors. Their genres are all very popular genres which also increases the likelihood that they share actors with other directors.

                </div>
                <p>The plot above illustrates the communities using different colours for each community. We see that the network is split into three bigger parts and two smaller parts at the right and one small community inside another one</p>
                <h3>Analysis of communities</h3>
                <p>We will look at three different attributes: language, genre, active period and rating, to see if anything can be said about the communities regarding these. We want to find out if the communities can be distinguished using any of these attributes.</p>
                
                <h3>Languages</h3>  
                <p> We have seperated the directors into groups of languages based on the language of their movies.</p>
                <div class="indented" style="display: flex; align-items: center; flex-direction: row">
                    <img style="display: flex; flex:5;" src="images/confusion_matrix_lang.png" alt="degree distribution" class="rounded img-fluid image image-2">
                    <div style="display: flex; flex: 3; padding-left: 20px">
                        <p style="display: flex;"> The figure shows a heatmap where each cell shows the percentage of the community that direct movies of that specific language. Community 3 and 5 seem to be based on language. Community 3 mostly has mostly directors of french movies and some italian movies, community 5 mostly directors of japanese and cantonese movies. The other communities have mostly directors of english movies however community 2 does have a higher percentage of movies of many of the smaller languages than the other communities. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Genres</h3>                
                <p>We have created one group for each genre and added directors to the groups that they have worked whithin. One director might have worked in more than one genre.</p>
                <div class="indented" style="display: flex; align-items: center; flex-direction: row">
                    <img style="display: flex; flex:5;" src="images/confusion_matrix_genres.png" alt="degree distribution" class="rounded img-fluid image image-2">
                    <div style="display: flex; flex: 3; padding-left: 20px">
                        <p style="display: flex;"> The figure shows a heatmap where each cell shows the percentage of the community that have directed movies in that specific genre. As mentioned above, each directed might have worked in multiple genres therefor the percentages for one community do not add up to 100%. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>We observe that all communities are a mix of multiple genres which makes sense since we know that directors and actors do not restrict themselves to a single genre. There are some genres that are quite common among all communities such as drama, comedy, romance, thriller and action. These are all genres that are somewhat general and a lot of movies will have these genres listed as their genre along with other more significant genres. There are however some differences between the communities that might be of significans. Communty 4 has directors working in multiple genres that are not as common in the other communities such as music, history, mystery, western and war. Community 5 has a high percentage of directors working in the genres foreign, fantasy and science fiction. Community 1 has a high percentage of directors working in the genres thrillers, mystery, horror and science fiction.</p>
                
                <h3>Active Period</h3>  
                <p> We have created one group for each decade and add directors to the group if they were active in that decade. We define the active period of a director as the time from the release of the first movie to the release of the last movie.</p>
                <div class="indented" style="display: flex; align-items: center; flex-direction: row">
                    <img style="display: flex; flex:5;" src="images/confusion_matrix_period.png" alt="degree distribution" class="rounded img-fluid image image-2">
                    <div style="display: flex; flex: 3; padding-left: 20px">
                        <p style="display: flex;"> The figure shows a heatmap where each cell is the percentage of the community that were active in that decade. A director can be active over a period of more than 10 years and hence can be in multiple groups. Therefor the percentages of each community do not add up to 100%. We observe that community 4 consists mainly of older movies. It makes sense that the directors of older movies are grouped together as not many of the same actors are acting in older as well as newer movies. We can also spot that directors of movies released after year 2000 are in community 0 and 2, while directors of movies from 1980-2000 are more dominant in community 1. Community 3 and 5 are not as concentrated on a specific period but are spread out from 1970 until 2020. </p>

                <h3>Rating</h3>                
                <p>We have divided the ratings into 5 groups of equal size: low, medium-low, medium, medium-high and high. The directors are then added to the group for which their agerage rating falls within.</p>

                        <p style="display: flex;"> The figure shows a heatmap where each cell is the percentage of the community that have a rating in that group. There does not seem to be a high correlation between rating and communities. Community 0 and 1 have a larger part of low rating directors while community 2, 3 and 5 have a larger part of high rating directors. Community 4 has the largest part around the medium rating. However there is not a huge difference in the numbers. </p>

                <h3>Conclusion about communities</h3>
                <p>So what can we say about the communities? First of all, the modularity is not significantly high, so the communities are not that solid. We examined different groupings of the directors to see if there is a correlation with the found communities. We tried grouping the directors by language, by genre, by active period and by rating. We discovered the following about the communities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Community 0 consists almost solely of directors of english movies. Regarding active period it consists mostly of directors active in the recent decades.</li>
                    <li>Community 1 also consist mainly of directors of english movies. It has a high percentage of directors working in drama, thrillers and action. Over half of the community has been rated below medium and most directors were active in the years 1980-2010.</li>
                    <li>Community 2 has a higher number of percentage of directors working in many of the smaller languages than the other communities. It consists mainly of directors active after 1990. Almost haf of the community has been rated above average.</li>
                    <li>Community 3 consists mainly of directors of french and italian movies. Most of the directors in that community are working with commedy and drama. The directors have been active in the last 50 or so years. Over half of the community has been rated above average.</li>
                    <li>Community 4 is characteries as being the community of directors of older movies. Most directors were active in the years 1940-1990. The genres are also a bit different than of the other communities. These directors were working more in the genres music, history, mystery, western and war which are genres that were more popular a few decades ago than they are today.</li>
                    <li>Community 5 consists mainly of directors of japanese and cantonese movies. These directors are directing foreign, fantasy and science fiction movies and a more than a third of the community has received a high rating.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The analysis showed that some of the communities seem to be defined by attributes such as language (3 and 5) and active period (4) while the others are more mixed and it's harder to distinguish what makes the community.
                </p>
                <b>So in what communities are our most central directors?</b>
                <p> Our guess would be in the mixed communities 0, 1 or 2. These are afterall also the largest communities and they seem to hold the more mainstreem directors.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Steven Spielberg: 2</li>
                    <li>Woody Allen: 1</li>
                    <li>Ridley Scott: 2</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The most central nodes are indeed in communies 1 and 2.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    The network we created consisted of movie directors which are connected if they have hired the same actors. The structure of the network resembles that of a social network and the small world property holds. The top three directors regarding centrality are all famous directors which have directed a lot of movies and mostly work in the more popular genres. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We found 6 communities within the network and analysed these to find out what made these communities. We found out that some of the communities seemed to be based on language and the active periods of the directors while some were more a general mix.
