When creating a movie, a director has the opportunity to shape very frame, every dialog as he or she likes
Therefor giving an infinite number of possibilities when shooting a movie
However, often, when we watch a new movie, we feel like oh i've seen this before or it was too predictable
But what makes a movie redundant, what are the codes and lazy habits ?
That's what we are trying to figure out.

For our research, we are using the kaggle movie dataset, which is split in 7 files and includes several datapoints like title, budget and genres just to name a few.

In addition to metadata, we are using movie subtitles from opensubtitles.org to get a deeper undersetanding of each movie

For example, we will be looking for which words are the most used depending on the movie's genre and it's director.

The whole dataset we are using contains around 45000 movies, metadata and subtitles combined account for more than 60Gb of data but because of performance and space issues, we decided to only work with a subset of data
We chose the 5000 movies with the highest revenue that already came out

So first, we are creating a network, where very node is a director and they are linked together if they have employed the same actor

If we draw the graph for our 18694 actors and our 2050 directors, we get this graph.

Because the first graph we tried to draw is too crowaded, we decided to create the actors graph as well. Two actors are linked together if they appeared on the same movie.

To avoid having too much nodes, we only selected actors with at least 500 connections.

But then, once we will have our results, what could be do with them ? Well we'll try to predict the most predictable movie from the most popular genre. This includes casting the best actors and the best director.
